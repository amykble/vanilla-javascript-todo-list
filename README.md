# Vanilla Javascript Todo List App

## Information about The Project

Going back to the basics is important. This todo list is built using the three main components of developing for the web: html, css and javascript. Sometimes, we get caught up with the latest frameworks, supersets, templates and so on. I've used them myself. I tried Pug (and didn't really like it ðŸ˜¥), I use Vue (and really like it ðŸ’š), and I've been interested static site generators recently. But I wanted to go back to the basics, and it's really helped me put things into perspective.

I first fell in love with front end web development when I started writing css. It is actually really powerful, especially in conjunction with vanilla javascript. For example, in this app I created a toast pop up by adding a css class with javascript, and then setting the class to be removed when the animation ends. It's clean and performs well.

This app could easily be built on, which I might do in the future. You could easily add local storage support, more animations, the ability to reorder the list items, multiple lists, and so on.
